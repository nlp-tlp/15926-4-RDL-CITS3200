## Agenda

* Informal Project Demonstration for any changes before final demo/submission
* Questions

### Questions + Team comments

### Client meeting

* Site is deployed on iso15926.org. Changes discussed in team meeting today will be auto-deployed as they are merged into main.
* Local hierarchy demo + questions
* Node info and selection demo + questions
* Toggle deprecated and labels demo + questions (on main branch already)

### Client meeting questions

* Extra links on parents expansion?
  * For consistency, since we are doing this for children nodes
  * Less complexity without extra links but if required could implement, just more data to send from route
* Button to bring you back to the global view?
  * Could search for Thing to get back
* Toggle deprecated and labels resets the graph.
  * Either leave, or fetch deprecated by default and just hide in frontend (more data transferred but won't reset)
* Search selection brings up local hierarchy, label selection brings up info in info sidepane.

### Discussed

* The levels above and below toggles are not necessary anymore due to the dynamic loading implemented
* Red line for extra children of parents is preferred as this was the case for children nodes so for consistency it would be good to have this for parents as well
* Melinda will demo the site in Norway, might be attended by other ISO committee members
* Melinda requested a demo video of how to use the site, no more than 3 or 4 minutes sent to her via Teams - will also be a deliverable for sprint 3

## Next meeting

* Final demo
* Date: To be set by Melinda next week as she will demo it in Norway.
  * Might be attended by other ISO committee members.
  * Not possible to do Monday, Melinda will confirm date and time
