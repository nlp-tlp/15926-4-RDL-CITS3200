# 15926-4-RDL-CITS3200

## Visualisation of the ISO 15926-4 Reference Data Library

## Overview

This project aims to develop an interactive visualisation for an equipment reference data library as described in the ISO 15926-4 Standard. The goal is to create a web-based interface that allows users to interrogate the data and visualise the hierarchical relations.

## Purpose

The current browser, https://data.15926.org/rdl/, is frustrating to use due to the lack of hierarchical visualisation. This project aims to enhance the user experience and improve data accessibility.
