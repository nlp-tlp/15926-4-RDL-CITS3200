## Introduction

ISO15926vis is an interactive graph visualisation for the equipment Reference Data Library (RDL) described in the [ISO 15926-4 Standard](https://15926.org/).

This project assists in navigating the hierarchical relationships of classes defined by the RDL, supplementing data on the [current RDL browser](https://data.15926.org/rdl/) on which the hierarchy can be difficult to interpret.

üöß This project is currently in the early stages of development and many things are subject to change. üöß

## Getting started

These instructions will install dependencies get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. This is also needed for testing and deployment. For self-hosting see the [deployment section](#deployment).

### Installing dependencies

Dependencies must first be installed before running the client / server / CLI.

#### Git clone

Git clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/nlp-tlp/15926-4-RDL-CITS3200.git
```

#### Setup script

A script is available to automatically run all the steps listed below for client and server dependencies.

‚ö†Ô∏è The script was built primarily for Linux systems and your system may not be compatible. If it fails (doesn't output "Setup complete") or your OS is incompatible with these instructions, you can install dependencies manually following the sections below. ‚ö†Ô∏è

The script requires Python Venv to run. If not already installed, run:

```
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

In the root directory, run:

```
./setup.sh
```

If you encounter the error `-bash: ./setup.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory` and you are using WSL:

Run `sed -i 's/\r$//' setup.sh`, then run the script again.

#### Client dependency installation

If you intend to run the client, download [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) from the official source or using a package manager for your OS.

Then, use NVM to install [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager):

```
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

Install NPM dependencies in the main directory for [Husky Git hooks](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and initialise Husky:

```
npm i
npx husky-init
cp .husky/pre-commit.example .husky/pre-commit
```

Install NPM dependencies for the client from the main directory with:

```
npm i --prefix src/client
```

#### Server / CLI dependency installation

It is recommended that you install the server / CLI Python packages in a virtual environment. Any will do, but the following are instructions for activating venv:

```
python3 -m venv src/server/venv
source src/server/venv/bin/activate
```

If you intend to run the server / CLI, install the dependencies from requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r src/server/requirements.txt
```

### Running the project

This project consists of a Vue client, Flask server, and command-line interface. The following instructions will run them locally.

#### Client

To access the Vue web interface, run from the root directory:

```
cd src/client
npm run dev
```

#### Server

To run the Flask server, run from the root directory:

```
cd src/server
flask run
```

#### CLI

üöß CLI setup is currently under development. üöß

## Development

The following sections include instructions for testing and adding dependencies, for use by developers.

### Testing

Testing frameworks have been set up for project functionality.

#### Server tests

Tests for the Flask server are written with Pytest. If you are already using a different virtual environment system, skip `source ./venv/bin/activate` below:

```
cd src/server
source ./venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

#### Client tests

üöß Client test framework setup is currently under development. üöß

#### CLI tests

üöß CLI test framework setup is currently under development. üöß

### Adding dependencies

Follow these steps if you need to add a package during development

#### Adding to client

Packages are added through NPM in the client directory.

For any dependencies that should be there in the production environment, run:

```
npm i <package_name> --save
```

For any dependencies needed for development but not prod (e.g. type checking with ESLint), run:

```
npm i <package_name> --save-dev
```

#### Adding to server

Packages should be added through `pip` in your virtual environment:

```
pip install <package_name>
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

###

## Deployment

### Docker

You can host the client and server locally with Docker. This requires the Docker CLI to be installed with docker compose.

Note that changes to main files (dependencies, settings, etc.) require the containers to be rebuilt.

From the root directory, run:

```
cd src
docker compose up --build
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If using WSL, the docker desktop app must be [installed and configured for WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/). ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Credits

This project is being developed by students of the University of Western Australia (UWA) as part of the unit CITS3200 (Professional Computing), as Team 14 of the 2024 Semester 2 cohort.

Our team members include: Cameron O‚ÄôNeill, Heidi Leow, Paul Maingi, Ryan Dorman, Shuai Shao, and Vinita Rathore.
